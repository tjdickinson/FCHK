					<h4 class="subheading" id="about">About FontCreator Hotkeys</h4>
					<p>FontCreator already has a number of keyboard shortcuts (or hotkeys), but many frequently used features do not have keyboard shortcuts currently built into the program. FontCreator Hotkeys&nbsp;(FCHK) more than doubles the number of hotkeys available to the program, and modifies some of the preexisting hotkeys for easier use or for compatibility with the newly created shortcuts.</p>
					<p>FCHK is a script wrapped into an executable&nbsp;(.exe) file. It is not a program, and it does not install on your system. As such, the files need to be stored on your computer or on a USB stick in a safe place. It is recommended to create a folder called FCHK in the user directory C:\Users\[User]\ (replace [User] with your username), or on your Desktop, and to unzip the contents of FCHK.zip into it. <a href="#howtoupdate">When downloading updates</a>, replace the files in that directory with the updated files.</p>
					<p>Please note: FCHK and its developer are not associated with High‑Logic&nbsp;B.V. or with AutoHotkey Foundation&nbsp;LLC.</p>
					<footer class="back">

					</footer>
					<h4 class="subheading" id="compat">Compatibility</h4>
					<p>This script is developed for High‑Logic&nbsp;B.V.&rsquo;s FontCreator Professional&nbsp;11. Because of FCHK&rsquo;s dependency on the screen layout, it may not be compatible with older or newer versions, or with other editions, of FontCreator. Click here to <a href="http://www.high-logic.com/shop/new-licenses.html">buy</a> or <a href="http://www.high-logic.com/shop/upgrades.html">upgrade</a> to the latest version of FontCreator.</p>
					<p>Note: While FontCreator&nbsp;11 <em>is</em> necessary to ensure compatibility, the Professional version may not be absolutely necessary. In theory, the hotkeys should still work with Home or Standard version. However, keep in mind that certain features of the program itself are not available on the Home or Standard licenses.</p>
					<p>FontCreator and AutoHotkey are currently only available for Windows operating systems. These programs, and this FCHK script, will not work on non‑Windows platforms.</p>

					<h3 class="heading" id="howto">How to Use FontCreator Hotkeys</h3>
					<h4 class="subheading" id="fclayout">FontCreator Layout</h4>
					<p>Because the current version of FontCreator does not include every tool in the main menu, some shortcuts are mapped to precise coordinates within the window. In other words, typing the hotkey tells the mouse to move to a certain place on the screen, to click in that location, and then to return to its starting position. For the script to work properly, therefore, it is necessary that your FontCreator window has the layout FCHK needs. Otherwise, there is no way for the mouse to find the correct button.</p>
					<p>Understandably, this may be inconvenient for some users. You are welcome to <a href="#mod">make changes</a> to the script, but remain aware of compatibility issues and updates. The developer is not able to resolve bugs or issues caused by modifications to the script.</p>
					<p style="page-break-after: avoid;">The window layout should be arranged as follows:</p>
					<img src="Images/FC_layout.png" width="1166" height="100" alt="FontCreator toolbar layout">
					<ol>
						<li>The main menu bar (File, Edit, View&hellip;), highlighted yellow in the image, must be at the top of the screen.</li>
						<li>The standard toolbar (New Document, Open, Save, Print&hellip;), highlighted orange, must be directly underneath the menu bar, aligned to the left of the window.</li>
						<li>The overview toolbar, highlighted green, must be to the right of and in‑line with the standard toolbar, ensuring that all of the standard toolbar buttons are visible, and there are no gaps between the two toolbars.</li>
						<li>The align or distribute toolbar, highlighted red, must be immediately to the right of the overview toolbar, again, with no gaps, and ensuring all the buttons are visible.</li>
						<li>The drawing toolbar (Selection, Measure, Knife&hellip;), highlighted blue, must be docked immediately below the standard toolbar, also aligned flush to the left.</li>
						<li>The glyphs toolbar, highlighted in purple, must be docked immediately to the right of the drawing toolbar, ensuring all buttons in both toolbars remain visible, and that there are no gaps between the toolbars.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>This top area of the screen is absolute, and FCHK will not function correctly if it is not laid out as described. Other toolbars and windows may be open and docked below these toolbars, or to the right, left, or bottom of the screen, provided that the layout, button size, and visibility of the top‑frame toolbars is not changed or impeded or obscured.</p>
					<p>Currently, no hotkeys are designed to work in the tool windows, but a future update will incorporate this feature. Some shortcuts, but not many, are already available by default for some FontCreator tool windows (such as the OpenType Designer), and these hotkeys will continue to function.</p>

					<h4 class="subheading" id="run">Running the Script</h4>
					<p>To use FCHK, download FCHK-<span class="version">0.0.0</span>.zip from GitHub. In it, you will find three files: FCHK_<span class="version">0.0.0</span>.exe, FCHK_<span class="version">0.0.0</span>.ahk, and this README.html. After downloading, unzip the files to a safe and memorable location (such as C:\Users\[User]\FCHK\ or C:\Users\[User]\Desktop\FCHK\). Note that you do not need an internet connection to access this documentation file after it is saved to your computer.</p>
					<p>To run the script, double‑click on FCHK_<span class="version">0.0.0</span>.exe, or right‑click the file and choose &ldquo;Open&rdquo;. The script will immediately start running in the background of the operating system. There is no installation, but a message box should open to indicate the script is running. Neither FontCreator nor the computer need to be restarted. (In fact, restarting the computer stops the script, and the script will need to be re‑executed each time the system boots.)</p>
					<p>To verify the script is running successfully, a green icon should appear in the system tray. If there is no icon in the tray, check Task Manager to see that FCHK_<span class="version">0.0.0</span>.exe is running.</p>
					<p>To launch the file automatically when Windows boots:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Go to the&nbsp;.exe file, right‑click on it, and select &ldquo;Copy&rdquo;</li>
						<li>Navigate to C:\Users\[User]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\</li>
						<li>Right‑click in the window and choose &ldquo;Paste Shortcut&rdquo;</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Note that changing the location or name of the&nbsp;.exe file will create an error in the shortcut destination. To resolve this issue, simply rename the&nbsp;.exe file as &ldquo;FCHK.exe&rdquo; before creating the shortcut. Then, whenever you update FCHK, give it the same name (and delete the old file). If you change the location of the&nbsp;.exe file, then you will have to recreate or remap the shortcut accordingly.</p>
					<footer class="back">
						<a href="#top">Back to Contents</a>
					</footer>
					<h4 class="subheading" id="interface">Interface Note</h4>
					<p>While using FCHK, you might notice your mouse jumping around the screen. This is normal behavior and not anything to be concerned about. <a href="#fclayout">As previously mentioned</a>, some of the hotkeys need to simulate mouse clicks. For example, when pressing Shift+D (Free Draw Contour tool), the script tells the mouse to move to certain coordinates on the screen (over the button for the Free Draw Contour tool). Although this movement happens instantaneously, for a brief moment, you might see your mouse arrow move to the button. FCHK is programmed to return the mouse cursor to the same position it started in, so you never lose track of your pointer.</p>
					<footer class="back">
						<a href="#top">Back to Contents</a>
					</footer>
					<h4 class="subheading" id="stop">Stopping the Script</h4>
					<p>To temporarily pause the script, right‑click the tray icon and choose &ldquo;Suspend Hotkeys&rdquo;. The icon will turn red. Do not click &ldquo;Pause Script&rdquo;, as this has a different effect. Click again on &ldquo;Suspend Hotkeys&rdquo; to turn them on again; the icon will change back to green.</p>
					<aside>
						<p>FCHK will only affect a running, open, and active FontCreator window. That means (1)&nbsp;FontCreator must be running, (2)&nbsp;FontCreator must be visible (not minimized), and (3)&nbsp;FontCreator must be active, that is, the currently selected window. If any of these conditions are not met, the hotkeys in FCHK will have &ldquo;no effect&rdquo;. In other words, you do not need to disable FCHK when working in other programs; the default hotkeys of other programs will continue to function as usual. For example, Ctrl+I in FCHK opens an installed font. But in a Microsoft Word document, even when FCHK is still running, Ctrl+I will still italicize text. If Word and FontCreator are opened side‑by‑side, and the active cursor is in Word, Ctrl+I will create italics, Ctrl+R will right‑align the paragraph, and Alt+R will activate the Review tab of the ribbon. If you then click on FontCreator to activate the window, now Ctrl+I will open an installed font, Ctrl+R will have no effect, and Alt+R will right‑align a selected object. In short, it is safe to keep FCHK running in the background while working in other programs.</p>
					</aside>
					<p>To exit the script, right‑click on the tray icon and choose &ldquo;Exit&rdquo;. This closes the script. To re‑enable the hotkeys, run the program again by double‑clicking the executable file.</p>
					<p>To remove the script, simply delete the file either by selecting it and pressing &ldquo;Delete&rdquo; on the keyboard, or by dragging and dropping it into the Recycle Bin. Since it is not a program, it does not need to (and, in fact, cannot) be uninstalled, and it cannot be found in the list of installed applications on the system. Note that deleting the file completely removes it from your system, and you will need to download it again from the GitHub repository.</p>

					</footer>
					<h4 class="subheading" id="mod">Modifying the Script</h4>
					<p>Under the <a href="license">Open Source license</a>, users are allowed to modify FCHK. To modify the script, <a href="https://autohotkey.com/download/">AutoHotkey needs to be installed</a>. After installation, navigate to the folder containing the file FCHK_<span class="version">x.x.x</span>.ahk. Right‑click the file and choose &ldquo;Edit Script&rdquo;. (Alternately, choose &ldquo;Open with&hellip;&rdquo; and select &ldquo;Notepad&rdquo;.) Do not double‑click, as this will launch the script.</p>
					<p>You may wish to modify the hotkeys either to change the hotkey (ex.&nbsp;to press&nbsp;S to activate the Selection tool), or to modify the coordinates for a different screen layout. If you change a hotkey, ensure that it is not also assigned to another function, as this will cause the script to fail. Modifying the coordinates is a more complicated process, involving using a &ldquo;window spy&rdquo; to find the coordinate values. See the <a href="https://autohotkey.com/docs/AutoHotkey.htm">AutoHotkey documentation</a> for help with modifying the script.</p>
					<p>Please note: remember to send bug reports to the developer before trying to modify or fix them yourself. If you make any modifications, it is recommended that you also save them in a separate&nbsp;.txt file. When FCHK updates are available, you can then copy and paste your customizations into the new code. Otherwise, your changes will be lost when you use a newer release of the script.</p>

					<h3 class="heading" id="updates">Updates</h3>
					<h4 class="subheading" id="howtoupdate">Updating FCHK</h4>
					<p>FCHK will not update automatically. You will need to manually download and &ldquo;install&rdquo; (i.e.&nbsp;save to your computer) the updated files. To be notified when updates are available, <a href="https://github.com/tjdickinson/FCHK/subscription">click here</a> and choose &ldquo;Watch&rdquo;. Then go to <a href="https://github.com/settings/notifications">your notification settings</a> and ensure &ldquo;Watching&gt;&gt;Email&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pull Request pushes&rdquo; are checked. (The other boxes can be checked or unchecked according to your preference.) Then you will receive an email whenever a new version is uploaded to GitHub.</p>
					<p>To get the update, simply download the new&nbsp;.zip folder as you did when you first downloaded FCHK, and extract the files to the same location (ex.&nbsp;C:\Users\[User]\FCHK\). Overwrite any duplicate files and delete any old files. If you created a shortcut to run FCHK at windows startup, rename the new&nbsp;.exe file to match the shortcut target, or update the shortcut to target the new&nbsp;.exe file.</p>
					<footer class="back">
						<a href="#top">Back to Contents</a>
					</footer>
					<h4 class="subheading" id="planned">Planned Updates</h4>
					<p>A future update will include hotkeys for each tool window in FontCreator, as well as a full set of hotkeys for the OpenType Developer window. Because of the complexity of these windows, it is a difficult and time‑consuming task to write the scripts for them. At this point, there is no anticipated release date for the update, but it will certainly come.</p>

					<p>For example: In FontCreator, Ctrl+Shift+S is the <em>default</em> hotkey for &ldquo;Save all&rdquo;. However, in FCHK, Ctrl+Shift+S has been <em>redefined</em> as &ldquo;Save as&rdquo;. The function &ldquo;Save all&rdquo; has been <em>reassigned</em> to the hotkey Ctrl+Alt+S.</p>

						Copyright &copy;&nbsp;1989,&nbsp;1991 Free Software Foundation,&nbsp;Inc.<br>
						51&nbsp;Franklin&nbsp;Street, Fifth&nbsp;Floor, Boston,&nbsp;MA 02110&ndash;1301&nbsp;USA</h4>
						<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
						<h5 class="license" id="licpreamble">Preamble</h5>
						<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation&rsquo;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.</p>
						<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>
						<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p>
						<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
						<p>We protect your rights with two steps:&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;copyright the software, and (2)&nbsp;offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.</p>
						<p>Also, for each author&rsquo;s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors&rsquo; reputations.</p>
						<p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone&rsquo;s free use or not licensed at all.</p>
						<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</p>
						<h5 class="license" id="lictandc">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h5>
						<p>0.&nbsp;This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The &ldquo;Program&rdquo;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a &ldquo;work based on the Program&rdquo; means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term &ldquo;modification&rdquo;.) Each licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.</p>
						<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p>
						<p>1.&nbsp;You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&rsquo;s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>
						<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p>
						<p>2.&nbsp;You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&nbsp;1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
						<ol class="license" id="liclistpar2">
							<li>You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</li>
							<li>You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</li>
							<li>If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception:&nbsp;if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</li>
						</ol>
						<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>
						<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.</p>
						<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.</p>
						<p>3.&nbsp;You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section&nbsp;2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections&nbsp;1&nbsp;and&nbsp;2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>
						<ol class="license" id="liclistpar3">
							<li>Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine‑readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&nbsp;1&nbsp;and&nbsp;2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;&nbsp;or,</li>
							<li>Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine‑readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections&nbsp;1&nbsp;and&nbsp;2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;&nbsp;or,</li>
							<li>Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection&nbsp;b above.)</li>
						</ol>
						<p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.</p>
						<p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
						<p>4.&nbsp;You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>
						<p>5.&nbsp;You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.</p>
						<p>6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&rsquo; exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.</p>
						<p>7.&nbsp;If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty‑free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p>
						<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>
						<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</p>
						<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
						<p>8.&nbsp;If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p>
						<p>9.&nbsp;The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
						<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &ldquo;any later version&rdquo;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
						<p>10.&nbsp;If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>
						<h5 class="license" id="licwarranty">NO WARRANTY</h5>
						<p>11.&nbsp;BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
						<p>12.&nbsp;IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
