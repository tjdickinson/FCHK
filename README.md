# FontCreator Hotkeys
Download the .exe file [here](https://github.com/tjdickinson/FCHK/releases/latest)

See the documentation [here](https://tjdickinson.github.io/FCHK/index.html)

<p>FontCreator already has a number of keyboard shortcuts (or hotkeys), but many frequently used features do not have keyboard shortcuts currently built into the program. FontCreator Hotkeys&nbsp;(FCHK) more than doubles the number of hotkeys available to the program, and modifies some of the preexisting hotkeys for easier use or for compatibility with the newly created shortcuts.</p>
<p>FCHK is a script wrapped into an executable&nbsp;(.exe) file. It is not a program, and it does not install on your system. As such, the files need to be stored on your computer or on a USB stick in a safe place. It is recommended to create a folder called FCHK in the user directory C:\Users\[User]\ (replace [User] with your username), or on your Desktop, and to unzip the contents of FCHK.zip into it. <a href="https://tjdickinson.github.io/FCHK/index.html#howtoupdate">When downloading updates</a>, replace the files in that directory with the updated files.</p>
<p>Please note: FCHK and its developer are not associated with High‑Logic&nbsp;B.V. or with AutoHotkey Foundation&nbsp;LLC.</p>
